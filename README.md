## Project Title
Introduction to Problem Solving and Algorithm Design

## About
These are programs I made during my 8 week course introducing me to Python. We covered a variety of topics to get comfortable with basic programming concepts. I figured I would document my learning progress to be able to see how I've improved. It is also helping me learn the basics of Git/Github for version control and improving my command line skills.

## Learning Breakdown
Week 1:
Introduced to programming with Python including installing python and using the IDE, variables, and print command. I also learned the four phases of programming; Analysis, Design, Code, Test.

Week 2:
Covered variable types, defining the main program, user input, comments.

Week 3:
Implemented boolean expressions and if statements.

Week 4:
Took a leap forward with learning about functions and function calls. Defined my own function and used built in functions.

Week 5:
This week I learned about loops and the while statement. Student grades iterates through a list of students and asks for grades for each. It then returns the name of the student with the highest weighted grade.

Week 6:
I learned about working with strings, such as traversing through a string and string slicing and counting. The "PassCheck" program iterates through a "password" input by the user and ensures it meets the complexity requirements.

Week 7:
We covered traversing, slicing, and operating on arrays. The "Road Trip" program takes information from the user about a road trip, adds it to multiple arrays and then does computatations on the array.

Week 8:
In my "Final Project" I added onto the cleaning program from week 3 & 4. I learned more about validating user input and adding more functions to work together.

Outcome:
Overall, this course was good introduction to Python. There are still a few things I feel I am missing like proper ways of validating user input. Also we did not touch on classes at all, but I have familiarized myself with the concepts using materials from outside the course. I look forward to my next course "Introduction to Programming"
